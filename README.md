# Linking Land Registry Price Paid Data (PPD) and Domestic Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs)
All matching rules were written in R with data inputs and outputs stored in a PostGIS database.
## 1. Getting Started
This project is the code part of authors' article which will submit in Scientific Data, code will not open until it accepted from the data journel. The linked dataset is under review of UK Data Service.  



## 2. Data linkage
Run the PPD_EPC_linkage.R.
- ***casa*** is the all the linked results from the four stages matching
- ***result2*** is linked result has the recent EPCs for each transaction

## 3. Evaluation of the data linkage 

## 4. Linked PPD between 2011 and 2019

## 5. Data cleaning 

## 6. User note for the linked data


## 7. Future research

The authors would like to thank David Lockett and Caroline Bray of Land Registry, who offered guidance on the Land Registry PPD. Thanks also to Jessica Williamson and Jake Mulley, who helped to transfer our questions on EPCs to the teams in MHCLG, allowing the authors to deepen their understanding of this data set at the end of this research. The authors also would like to thank Rob Liddiard of the UCL Energy Institute for sharing his expertise regarding EPC data during the earlier stages of this research.
